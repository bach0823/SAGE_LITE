Official PyTorch implementation of **SAGE**, a novel MoLEx architecture designed to handle variable shape, size, and texture topologies in medical image segmentation. As embodied in SAGE-ConvNeXt+ViT-UNet, it adapts automatically to diverse glandular structures by locally routing image patches to highly specialized convolution and transformer experts.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Hybrid CNN-Transformer Encoder:** Leverages ConvNeXt and ViT blocks to capture both local edge details and global spatial relationships.
- **Hierarchical SAGE Routing:** Patches are dynamically routed to a pool of 28 specialized experts based on their semantic and structural density (e.g., normal tissue vs. irregular carcinoma variants).
- **SAHub (Shape-Adapting Hub) Decoder:** Reconstructs complex boundaries using cross-attention mechanisms conditioned on expert embeddings.
- **Two-Stage Training:**
  - *Stage 1:* Train the full model to allow experts to learn diverse shape specializations.
  - *Stage 2:* Freeze core shared representations and selectively fine-tune adaptive pathways with differentiated learning rates.
